    <h2>Crucial; Terms, Tags, and Examples</h2>
    <b>HTML5</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>He will refer to this as the Living HTML standard. Some people used to refer to it as the collection
                of web development technologies outside of just html but that won't be the verbage we/I use.
                <a href='https://html.spec.whatwg.org/'>html standard</a>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Block vs Inline</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Inline elements fit in alongside other elements.
                Block level elements take up a whole block of space.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Span and Div tags</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>div is a generic container to hold things or group things together.
                It is a block level element.</p>
            <p>span is a generic container to hold or group things together, but
                is inline as opposed to block level.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <b>HTML Entities</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            HTML Entities all start with a & and end with a ; . They are used to represent things that can be hard to
            type in html.
            <a href='https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref'>HTML Entities List</a><br><br>
            Common examples are &lt; and &gt;. Another is the &amp; itself.<br>
            Note thate all entities have entity names, such as wht we used above, and they have entity numbers too.
            Example. &spades; and &#9824;
        </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Semantic Elements</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>More meaningful tags to use for blocks of html code. Two main reason for this are for tools such as
                web crawlers to more easily identify content. The other is for accessibiliy which is helpful for screen
                readers
                and other accessibiliy tools.
            </p>
            <ul>Examples

                <li>&lt;section&gt; Represents a stand alone section of a website that doesn't have a more specific html
                    semantic element.</li>
                <li>&lt;article&gt; A self contained composition on a site, application, etc, which is intended to be
                    independently distributed or resuable. e.g., syndication. Exmaples may include magazine and
                    newspaper articles, blog entry, weather widgets, etc. Articles typically use a heading (h1-h6).
                    address tags, datetime attributes can be helpful</li>
                <li>&lt;nav&gt; Anything on the page that provides navigation links; internal to another area of same
                    page or external to other sources. One sample showed was using a single nav to surround an unordered
                    list that had multiple links. He didn't use a nav for every link.</li>
                <li>&lt;main&gt; Surrounds the main content of the page, not including items that repeat on every page
                    such as nav bars</li>
                <li>&lt;header&gt; introductory content and usually includes nav content </li>
                <li>&lt;footer&gt; The footer of the page, also usually includes nav content.</li>
                <li>&lt;aside&gt; content not directly associted or perhaps indirectly related to the documents main
                    content. Side bars are one common use of such.</li>
                <li>&lt;summary&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;details&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;time&gt; represents time and can contain the datetime attribute which translates into
                    machine-readable format.</li>
                <li>&lt;figure&gt; For captions and can containt a figcaption tag within the figure. The figure, it's
                    caption, and it's contents are referenced as a single unit.</li>
                <li>There are other as well. Overall they are essential for SEO, redability, and screen readers</li>
            </ul>

        </li>

    <b>VSCode Tip: Emmet</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>A tool that helps write html. Comes in vscode but available as extension etc elsewhere.
                Example
                nav>ul>li> After that click tab and it will create a nav, then a ul
                in the nav and a li in the ul. Also emmet is what lets me type in nav + tab to get a nav element opening
                and closing tag.
                Sibling + sign can be used to create multipel tags in a line
                such as h1+h2+h3 but all on the same level instead of beign inside one another.
                Another one is multiplication such. One example is<br>
                ul>li>*5 followed by tab to get 5 li elements inside a ul.
                <br>
                Can also use <br> nav>ul>li*5>a$ <br>
                The $ can be used for numbering. The above would yield the following. (see html)
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a1></a1>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a2></a2>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a3></a3>

                    <li>
                        <a5></a5>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <b>sup element</b>
    <ul>
        <li>

                a<sup>2</sup></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <b>sub element</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Subscript is rendered below the baseline and sometimes smaller as well. Perhaps in chemistry. H<sub>2</sub>O
        </li>
    </ul>
    <b>hr element</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>hr element makes a horizontal line across the screen. Can be styled. No closing tag</p>
            <hr>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <b>br element</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The break, or br, element makes a line break in the content.</p>
